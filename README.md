# Policy Impact Calculator Web Application

## Overview

The **Policy Impact Calculator** is a full-stack web application that allows users to analyze the real-time financial impact of political policies. It integrates RSS feeds from political news sites, analyzes political statements using Natural Language Processing (NLP), and calculates tax and policy impacts based on user inputs such as income, inflation rates, and bond market data.

This project is divided into **Frontend** and **Backend** components:
- **Frontend (HTML/CSS/JS):** User interface for inputting data, viewing RSS feeds, and calculating policy impacts.
- **Backend (Python):** Fetches RSS feeds, processes political statements using NLP, and interacts with external APIs like `data.gov` to retrieve policy-related data.

## Features

1. **RSS Feed Integration**: Displays the latest political news and statements from a given RSS feed URL.
2. **NLP Analysis**: Uses NLP to analyze political statements and extract key policies and implications.
3. **Policy Data Integration**: Fetches real-time policy-related data from external sources like `data.gov`.
4. **Tax and Policy Calculator**: Allows users to enter their income and other variables to calculate tax liabilities and the impact of political policies.
5. **Visualizations**: Displays the financial impact of policies using graphs and charts.

## Prerequisites

To run the project, you will need:

- **Python 3.x** for the backend
- **Node.js** (optional for additional backend features or deployment)
- **Chart.js** (for visualizations in the frontend)
- **Feedparser**: Install via `pip install feedparser` for RSS feed parsing
- **Transformers**: Install via `pip install transformers` for NLP tasks
- **Requests**: Install via `pip install requests` for fetching data from APIs

## Setup and Installation

### Backend

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd project_root
   ```

2. Set up the Python environment and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Sample `requirements.txt`:
   ```txt
   feedparser
   transformers
   requests
   ```

3. Run the backend scripts to test their functionality:
   - For fetching RSS feeds:
     ```bash
     python3 backend/rss_feed.py
     ```
   - For NLP analysis:
     ```bash
     python3 backend/nlp_utils.py
     ```

4. (Optional) Run a Flask or FastAPI server to handle backend API routes:
   ```bash
   python3 backend/app.py
   ```

### Frontend

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
   ```bash
   open project_root/frontend/index.html
   ```
   
2. The calculator and RSS feed sections should be fully interactive. Make sure you adjust the RSS feed URL in the `rss_feed.py` script to fetch live data.

### API Integration (Optional)

To integrate data from `data.gov`, you will need an API key. Visit [data.gov](https://www.data.gov/) to create an account and obtain an API key, then modify the `data_fetch.py` script accordingly.

```python
# data_fetch.py
api_url = f"https://api.data.gov/policy-data?query={policy_name}&api_key=YOUR_API_KEY"
```

## Usage

### Running the RSS Feed Fetcher

To fetch the latest political news:

1. Open `rss_feed.py` in your terminal:
   ```bash
   python3 backend/rss_feed.py
   ```

2. The script will output the latest political statements and their links.

### Using the Tax and Policy Calculator

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
2. Enter your income in the input field under the "Tax and Policy Calculator" section.
3. Click the "Calculate Tax" button to view your estimated tax based on the input.

### Visualizing Policy Impact

1. The charts in `charts.js` will automatically render policy costs using dummy data. 
2. Modify the data in `charts.js` to reflect real-time policy impacts fetched from external sources.

```javascript
// Example dataset for policy impact visualization
const policyData = [200, 300, 150]; // Replace with actual data from the API
```

## Customization

- **RSS Feed**: Modify the RSS feed URL in `rss_feed.py` to fetch news from different sources.
- **NLP Analysis**: Extend `nlp_utils.py` to support additional NLP tasks such as sentiment analysis.
- **Calculator**: Expand the calculator to consider other variables such as inflation and bond rates.
- **Visualizations**: Add additional graphs and charts using libraries such as Chart.js or D3.js to enhance data representation.

## Future Enhancements

- **User Authentication**: Add user login functionality to save personalized data and track policy impact over time.
- **Policy Comparison**: Allow users to compare multiple policies side by side.
- **Mobile Support**: Improve the layout and responsiveness for better performance on mobile devices.

## Deployment

You can deploy the application on platforms like **Netlify** (for frontend) and **Heroku** or **Replit** (for backend). Here’s a simple deployment process:

### Netlify (Frontend)

1. Upload the `frontend` folder to Netlify.
2. Link your Git repository or use the **Netlify Drop** feature.

### Replit or Heroku (Backend)

1. Push the backend code to Replit or Heroku.
2. Set up the necessary environment variables such as the API key for `data.gov`.
